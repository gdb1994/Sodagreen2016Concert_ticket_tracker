##NOTICE!!
The program will link to every event one by one and run in a permanent loop.  
The program will open the purchase page with your default browser if there are tickets remaining in that event.  
Because of the rare oppotunities to access the purchase page, there is a few difficulties to debug XD.
It worked well on Windows 10 and OSX.

##HOW TO RUN
1. Make sure the version of python on your computer.
2. Run it on your command line tools.
