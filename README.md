# Sodagreen2016Concert_ticket_tracker
***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python3.py*** for **python 3.5** users  
***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python2.py*** for **python 2.7** users  

##NOTICE!!
***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python2.py*** worked well on **OSX** and was able to open the link of purchase page with default browser **Safari**.  
However, ***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python3.py*** stucked at openning the purchase page and I don't know why still. But you can identify which event has the ticket remaining by recognizing the event before stucking.  
Because of the rare oppotunities to access the purchase page, there is a few difficulties to debug XD.

##HOW TO RUN
1. Make sure the version of python on your computer.
2. Run it on your command line tools.
