***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python3.py*** for **python 3.5** users  
***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python2.py*** for **python 2.7** users  

##NOTICE!!
***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python2.py*** worked well on **OSX** and was able to open the link of purchase page with default browser **Safari**.  
However, ***sodagreen_ticket_tracker_python3.py*** stucked at openning the purchase page and I don't know why still.  
Because of the rare oppotunities to access the purchase page, there is a few difficulties to debug XD.
